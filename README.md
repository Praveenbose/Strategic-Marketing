Strengths
Tetley  India has a strong brand image and a vast array of products that can be considered as the company’s greatest advantages. The company has a rich history and is well known for its values such as quality, innovation, and trust among the consumers. Tetley’s portfolio of products includes different types of teas such as Green tea and Darjeeling Tea which makes it possible for Tetley to tap the market in different segments. This diversification minimizes the dependence on any specific product category and makes the business less vulnerable to market changes. Also, Tetley  India enjoys a strong distribution channel that ensures stock availability of its products in the market including the rural areas (Anand and Shrivastava, 2022). Supplier and market intermediary relationships make up the company’s supply chain, which is also strong and reliable. 
Weaknesses 
Tetley  India has the following internal weaknesses that may affect its performance. The first major downside that one can discern is regulatory risks and compliance matters. The sector is highly regulated and it is sensitive to issues of food safety and labeling and any company that is found to have violated any of these standards would suffer greatly in terms of reputation and fines (Jain, 2023). Also, Tetley has a broad product range which in some cases may cause problems with organizational structures and supply chains, making it more expensive and less effective. 
Other threats include the issue of quality control for all products and in all the areas of operation, which poses a threat to the reputation of the company among consumers (Joshi et al., 2020). Moreover, almost all the products of Tetley  India depend on raw materials imported from different parts of the world, which exposes it to risks associated with geo-political risks, trade barriers, or natural calamities (Biju, 2021). All these weaknesses require that an organisation take the necessary measures to manage risks and improve the operations of the business. 
Opportunities
The growth opportunities that are available to Tetley to help enhance its market position: The consumers' growing concern with their health and the willingness to consume healthy and nutritious products is a great opportunity for Tetley to diversify its range of new products (Panigrahi and Chaudhury, 2023). Through the capital expenditure in Research and Development to create better and healthier products, Tetley can lure health-conscious consumers and thus improve the brand image (Biswas et al., 2023). Also, the constantly evolving market, including the increased use of e-commerce and the internet provides Tetley with an opportunity to appeal directly to the consumers. 
Focusing on the presence of the World Wide Web and digital promotion can be useful for Tetley in increasing sales and penetration into the digital market, which is rapidly developing at the moment. In addition, the growing concern for sustainability and ethical sourcing gives Tetley a chance to improve its CSR and let people know about the company’s efforts towards the preservation of the environment and society (Anand and Shrivastava, 2022). When a company’s operations are in line with sustainability and it communicates it to the public, consumers will be more inclined to support the company because of its sustainability efforts. 
Threat 
Tetley is situated in a very competitive and volatile environment, which poses several threats to the operations of this company. A major risk that can be identified is high competition from local and global players hence the risk of losing market share and price cutting (Biju, 2021). They constantly evolve their products, and new products are introduced in the market Tetley must keep on innovating and marketing its products. 
Also, changes in the prices of raw materials, for example, Tea leaves and cocoa are risks to the cost and profitability of Tetley. The company needs to control these fluctuations through various procurement strategies and cost-control mechanisms. Another threat is the economic conditions and fluctuations in customer expenditure also affect Tetley’s sales and revenues (Joshi et al., 2020). This may be because, in periods of economic fluctuations, consumers might be forced to minimize their expenditure and hence reduce spending on non-essential items which may include some of Tetley’s products. 

3. Key Elements of the Micro Environment
3.1 Suppliers

Suppliers occupy an important place in any organization as they are the ones who offer the materials, goods, and services needed in the production and running of a business. To Tetley India, suppliers are the basic support of the complex supply chain management that provides the company with the necessary raw materials and components for its vast product offering. There are different aspects of supplier management, these include; building strong supplier relations, delivery schedules, quality and price negotiations. These disruptions can include delays, shortages, or poor quality that could impact production and schedules and consequently, the quality of the products (Rajput et al., 2020). Another strategic factor that Tetley India should also take into account is the issue of sustainable procurement to address the increasing consumers’ concern about sustainability and product origin. 

3.2 Customers
Customers are the source of revenue and the key to every organization’s success therefore their needs, behavior and preferences must be understood. Tetley India has its customers in individuals, small and big stores, restaurants and hotels, and other different categories with different requirements (Biju, 2021). Market segmentation means dividing the market into different groups and the selection of specific customers and their requirements to whom the products and services are marketed. Customers’ needs and expectations are met by providing and offering quality products, communicating with customers and solving their problems (Rajput et al., 2020). The fact that Tetleys India can manage change, especially in the area of consumer trends such as healthy and convenience drink is crucial in the competition.

The presence of competitors can be considered a natural component of the business environment affecting the market and strategic processes (Kalyani and Shukla, 2022). While competing in the highly competitive market of FMCG, Tetley India has to compete with both national and global players. Competitor analysis is the process of examining the competitors’ major characteristics and evaluating their actions and positions in the market.

This study posits that the public image of the company, as a result of its CSR activities, environmental conservation, and community involvement, determines the company’s brand reputation and consumer confidence (Sathyan and S. N., 2021). This way, positive public relations efforts and transparency in operations are likely to improve Tetley India’s image and create goodwill. Distributors, retailers, and marketing agencies are well-recognized market intermediaries who help sell and advertise Tetley’s products. Engaging with such intermediaries makes sure that the products get to the market, gain visibility, and penetrate the market accordingly (Rajput et al., 2020). Improving the relations with the intermediaries through proper business policies, assistance and compensations can improve the distribution channel and market coverage. 

3.5 Employees
Employees are the lifewire of Tetley as they contribute immensely to the achievement of the company’s objectives through their expertise, hard work, and creativity. Employee engagement is critical to productivity and the ability to sustain long-term improvements in the organisation. The Tetley India company ensures that the employees receive professional training to improve their performance as well as career progression (Sathyan and S. N., 2021). Diversity and inclusion policies of the firm guarantee that employees will be treated fairly and encouraged to work as a team. Thus, focusing on the employees’ well-being and interest not only helps Tetley India to increase motivation and employee turnover but also to create a dedicated staff that will contribute to the implementation of the company’s strategies (Kalyani and Shukla, 2022). This alignment is crucial to providing quality goods and services, satisfying customers’ needs, and realizing long-term organizational goals.

4. Conclusion

The key resources of Tetley India are its well-established brand image, a wide range of products, and a wide distribution network, which are the main advantages that contribute to the company’s positioning in the FMCG industry. 
Proper management of these strengths through strong supplier relations, product differentiation and market positioning helps the company to satisfy the consumers' needs and maintain market dominance. However, internal factors such as regulatory compliance, operational challenges and supply chain risks pose a threat to efficiency and product quality and therefore should be managed. The market trends include the demand for healthy products, the availability of online media, and the focus on environmentally friendly products as the areas for brand development. The threats such as increased competition, volatile raw material prices, and shifting regulations call for risk management and change management.
